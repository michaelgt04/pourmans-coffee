# Pourmans Coffee Company Website

My coworker Amanda and I tried the coffee at Pourmans one day in Dewey
Square and were hooked immediately. Their coconut cold brew is probably
the best coffee I've ever had! Upon returning to our office, we went online
to look the company up and saw that they didn't have much of a web presence.

After seeing this, we sent the team at Pourmans an email about making them 
a website. Soon after this, we made a deal to make them a site! 

Throughout the process, we've made sure to stay close to their existing
brand identity and develop for their needs. We've had weekly check-ins 
with them and sent along our works in progress as we headed towards an MVP.
This project is as much about learning how to build a website 
successfully for a client as it is about developing our skills in the 
technology involved.

It has been so awesome to work with the team at Pourmans and even more 
amazing to see our tech skills go into use for an actual company's production
site!

## Technologies

* React Redux Front End

	It was important that as Pourmans grows the business, we can continue
	to build out the React front end in a scalable way. Given how much easier
	Redux makes handling React state, this seemed like a natural choice. Also,
	since we built an admin interface for updating the content
	we wanted to be able to have Redux Form handle the various inputs.

* Rails back end (API)

	Rails makes creating a back end very easy. There was some JSON that needed
	to be somewhat nested, so we wanted to be able to use ActiveModel Serializer.
	This made creating our internal API much simpler and easier to scale as we 
	continue to build out the site.

* Agile Practices
	
	This also was an opportunity for Amanda and I to practice agile software
	practices, such as TDD and continuous delivery. We have a staging site to
	allow our client to do acceptance for any updates. We've separated out the features
	into software stories and kept our client at the center of the design. In side
	projects that both of us have worked on before, we tried to develop our skills 
	in this area, but this site has provided an excellent opportunity to put those skills
	to the test in an environment with an actual client.
